Pre-requesites:
1. Installation of ROOT
2. Installation of fastjet

Workflow:
0. Store your data in a directory "samples/"
1. Run PUPPI
2. Plot the information

-------------------------

To compile the code for step 1:
$ make clean
$ make

To run the code for step 1: 
$ ./puppiAnalyzer nEvents PUScenario

Inputs: 
nEvents = number of events to run over
PUScenario = 20 or 80 or 140, depending on the file

-------------------------

Then, you get a ROOT file, there are trees for the jet collection for each type of jets (gen, pf, puppi, etc.) 
and a tree for the particle level information in the first 25 events.

Some plotting scripts are available, but no synchronized at the moment...to be continued...
